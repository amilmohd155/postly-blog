A man wakes up in a closed room. The room is small, vacant except for a table that contains a letter and va small chest. The man is in a dizzy state. He doesn’t seems to know where he is at. He is confused and scared. He looks around, searching for answers. He sees the table. He walks towards the table. He sees the letter. The man reads it

> *“The chest contains an invaluable treasure (The Rabbit’s Foot)”*

The man looks the table amused.

> ***“The key to The Room lies within the chest”***

He takes the chest in his hands.

> ***“Breaking the chest will destroy the treasure”***

The man keeps the chest down. Checks it out properly. The chest is old. He thinks,

> “It really must besomething valuable”

He gazes at the door, he gulps *,*

> *“Well, Getting out of here is easy”*

The man decides to break open the chest. He touches the chest; he sees The Wife.

Back home; days before

The wife and the man are arguing over their financial footing. Their home is nearly in the stage of breaking apart.an old house reeks of extreme poverty. The wife is angry at the man for being irresponsible and jobless. She is tired and lean. She is equally sad for being angry at her other half. She can understand his situation but she just is tired of her life. There is a kid’s cry from inside the room. The house is riotous with all the noises, it’s awfully intolerable and saddening.

He drops the chest on the table.

> *“I can’t destroy it. The treasure! I need it, my family needs it. I CAN’T DESTROY IT”*

The room is half-filled now .racks and racks of books and paper is filling the room. The room around him is oblivious to the man. He is deep in thought.

He can see the wife happy to see him. His kids near her. She is exceedingly glad to see him. They rejoice after their estrangement. The world is celebrating with them. He can see a BRIGHTER TOMORROW. He decides to break the chest. Acquire the key and fight for his life. He holds the chest in his hands, ready to break it.

After all the celebrations, the man and the wife again start to have troubles. She is no longer can see her children suffer. She can no longer see the light of hope shine on her. She decides to end it. She decides to kill herself and her child and end their sufferings. The man sees all of this and he is heartbroken. He doesn’t know whether to stop them or to join them. As the man keeps looking, the wife slits her child’s throat and hangs herself. The man can see his child’s blood covered body and his wife’s lifeless hanging self but he stays put and does nothing.

The man drops the chest on the table. He withdraws from the table. He cries for mercy. He no longer knows what to do. He looks around the room and he sees the room is nearly filled with racks, some empty, some full of books. The room is shrinking. He rushes towards the door, bang on it he cries.

He cries and he cries...

Time goes on, he is afraid to go to the table, he is afraid to accept the truth, he is afraid to realize his failures. He stays near the door, begging it to be opened. Crying for mercy.

The room is chock-full. He no longer can move.
