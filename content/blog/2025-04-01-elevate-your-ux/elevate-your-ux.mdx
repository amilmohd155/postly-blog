When it comes to web development, adding unique interactions can significantly elevate the user experience. A custom cursor is a simple yet effective way to achieve that. In this article, we’ll explore how to create a custom cursor using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and React, focusing on smooth animations and responsiveness.

# Why Use GSAP for Animations?

GSAP is a robust JavaScript library tailored for high-performance animations. Its versatility and ease of use make it a go-to choice for creating smooth, interactive effects. With GSAP, you can achieve frame-perfect animations, even in performance-intensive environments.

# Prerequisites

To follow along, you’ll need:

* Basic knowledge of React
* Familiarity with JavaScript and GSAP

# Setting Up the Project

1. **Set Up Your React App**: If you haven’t already, create a new React app using Create React App or your preferred setup. I used vite with tailwindcss here.
2. Install Dependencies:

```txt
npm install gsap @gsap/react
```



# Breaking Down the Code

## 1. Refs for Cursor and Follower

We use `useRef` to create references for the cursor and its follower. These references enable direct DOM manipulation.

```tsx
const cursorRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);
const followerRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);
```

## 2. Using GSAP’s `quickTo`

The `quickTo` method efficiently sets element properties, ensuring smooth and high-performance animations. We use it to update the `x` and `y` positions of the cursor and follower.

```tsx
/* Gsap allows the use of either element id, classname or ref */

// using element id (ie, "#cursor", "#follower"
const cursorXSetter = gsap.quickTo("#cursor", "x", {
  duration: 0.2,
  ease: "power3",
});
// using ref
const cursorYSetter = gsap.quickTo(cursorRef.current, "y", {
      duration: 0.2,
      ease: "power3",
});
```

## 3. Adding Event Listeners

A `mousemove` event listener captures the user’s mouse position, which is then used to update the cursor and follower positions.

```tsx
window.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  const x = e.clientX;
  const y = e.clientY;

  cursorXSetter(x);
  cursorYSetter(y);
  followerXSetter(x);
  followerYSetter(y);
});
```

## 4. Rendering the Cursor and Follower

The cursor and follower are styled spans positioned absolutely. The cursor is a small black dot, while the follower is a larger circle that trails the cursor.

```tsx
<>
  <span id="cursor" ref={cursorRef} />
  <span id="follower" ref={followerRef} />
</>
```

# Styling

Here, the styles are applied using CSS, but you can adapt them to any styling approach. The key points are:

* **Fixed Positioning**: To make the cursor and follower independent of the page layout.
* **Pointer Events None**: To ensure these elements don’t interfere with user interactions.

```css
html,
body {
  cursor: none; //required to disable the default cursor
}

#cursor,
#follower {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none; 
  z-index: 50; // ensures the pointer is always on top

  // Styling specific to this example
  border-radius: 999px;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

#cursor {
  height: 0.5rem;
  width: 0.5rem;
  background-color: black;
}

#follower {
  height: 2rem;
  width: 2rem;
  background-color: transparent;
  border: 1.5px solid black;
}
```

here is the TailwindCSS styling for the same

```tsx
// Cursor main component
<span
  className="pointer-events-none fixed z-50 h-1 w-1 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full bg-black"
/>
//Cursor follower component
<span
  className="pointer-events-none fixed z-50 h-8 w-8 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 rounded-full border border-black bg-transparent"
 />
```

# Rendering the Component

Finally, the `CustomCursor` component is rendered alongside the main application:

```tsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <CustomCursor />
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```



# The Mechanics Behind the Movement

At the core of the custom cursor effect is GSAP’s ability to smoothly transition between values. Here’s how the cursor and follower move:

**Cursor Movement**:

* The cursor element is animated to directly follow the mouse position. This is achieved by calling the `gsap.quickTo` method for both the `x` and `y` properties, setting the duration to `0.2` seconds. This ensures the cursor reacts almost instantly to the mouse movement, creating a responsive and snappy feel.

**Follower Movement**:

* The follower element also tracks the mouse position, but with a delay. This is where the magic of the trailing effect comes in. The `gsap.quickTo` method for the follower has a longer `duration` of `0.6` seconds. This slower transition causes the follower to lag behind the cursor, giving the visual impression that it’s "following" the cursor's movement.
* The difference in duration between the cursor and follower’s animations is crucial for the effect. By slowing down the follower’s movement, we create a sense of depth and fluidity, making the interaction feel more dynamic.

## **UseGSAP**

The `useGSAP` hook is used to integrate GSAP animations within React's component lifecycle in a seamless and efficient way. Here’s why it’s useful:

1. **Syncs with React’s Lifecycle**: It ensures animations are properly triggered when the component mounts and cleaned up when it unmounts, avoiding issues with React’s rendering cycle.
2. **Manages Refs and Animations**: It helps animate DOM elements (like the cursor and follower) using `useRef` while ensuring the animations don’t conflict with React's state and re-renders.
3. **Declarative Control**: Encapsulates GSAP’s imperative API within React’s declarative structure, making animations easier to manage and less error-prone.
4. **Efficient Animation**: By using `useGSAP`, animations are triggered only when necessary, improving performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders.

# Full Code

```tsx
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
import gsap from "gsap";
import { useRef } from "react";

const CustomCursor = () => {
  const cursorRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);
  const followerRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);

  useGSAP(() => {
    const cursorXSetter = gsap.quickTo("#cursor", "x", {
      duration: 0.2,
      ease: "power3",
    });
    const cursorYSetter = gsap.quickTo(cursorRef.current, "y", {
      duration: 0.2,
      ease: "power3",
    });

    const followerXSetter = gsap.quickTo(followerRef.current, "x", {
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: "power3",
    });
    const followerYSetter = gsap.quickTo("#follower", "y", {
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: "power3",
    });

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
      const x = e.clientX;
      const y = e.clientY;

      cursorXSetter(x);
      cursorYSetter(y);
      followerXSetter(x);
      followerYSetter(y);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <span id="cursor" ref={cursorRef} />
      <span id="follower" ref={followerRef} />
    </>
  );
};

export default CustomCursor;
```

# Customizing the Effect

This custom cursor effect is highly customizable. Here are some ideas for further enhancement:

1. **Change Cursor Shapes**: You could replace the circular cursor with a custom image or another shape.
2. **Multiple Followers**: Add multiple follower elements with different delays to create a more complex and layered effect.
3. **Cursor Interaction**: You could add interaction with other elements on the page, where the cursor or follower changes shape or color when hovering over certain areas

Happy coding….
